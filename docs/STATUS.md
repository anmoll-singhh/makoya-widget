# Makoya — STATUS (central memory dashboard)

> **This is the single glance-able source of truth.** Read this first; it answers "where are we, what's in flight, what's blocked, what's next."
> Detailed narrative history lives in [`SESSION.md`](./SESSION.md) (append-only log). This file is the *dashboard view* on top of it.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-06-25 · **Updated by:** Claude (block 16 — Redline design-system FOUNDATION merged to main + verified; surfaces next)
>
> **Backup status:** ✅ All branches pushed to `origin` (github.com/anmoll-singhh/makoya-widget). No work is local-only.
>
> **How to ask for an update:** open this file, or tell any agent *"read docs/STATUS.md and tell me the status."*
> **How agents keep it true:** see [§ Update protocol](#-update-protocol). Update this file at the end of every work block, before SESSION.md.

## 🚦 At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Current phase** | **Phase H — bulletproofing (code+DB+CI DONE; rest founder-gated)** · then Phase 2 billing = **Stripe** |
| **Prod URL** | https://makoya-gamma.vercel.app (deployed from `main`, manual `vercel --prod`) |
| **Prod = state** | ✅ **LIVE on `main`** — Phase 1.5 (token wall + core-bypass close) + scanner second-engine deployed 2026-06-25 (`dpl_HWjCBHvCGdP5t52nwBQwE2kfheNi`). Verified live: loader forwards `?t=`, core.js fetch-gates, `/api/config?t=` → `no-store`+`active:true` (monitor), `/api/public-scan`→200. **Token + enforcement both ship OFF** (monitor). |
| **Canonical branch** | `main` — all code merged + QA-green + deployed |
| **Biggest risk right now** | Set `WIDGET_SIGNING_SECRET` in Vercel + watch monitor logs BEFORE ever flipping `WIDGET_ENFORCE` (avoid the two-flag lockout — plan A2 truth table). Shopify publish still founder-gated (Partner account). |
| **Next founder unblock** | Stripe account · enable Supabase leaked-password toggle · free accounts (Sentry/PostHog/Upstash/Inngest) · rotate leaked keys |

## 🤖 Agent / worktree coordination board

> **You often run 2–3 Claude sessions at once. This board prevents collisions.** Claim your lane before editing. **Never edit files outside your worktree's lane.** Past failure to never repeat: an agent wrote into the *main* checkout despite having its own worktree.

| Worktree | Branch | Owner / purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C:\Users\ANMOL\Desktop\makoya` | `feat/phase-1-licensing` | **Widget license + domain gate (Phase 1)** | ✅ MERGED + **DEPLOYED LIVE** (monitor); branch prunable |
| `C:\Users\ANMOL\Desktop\makoya` | `feat/phase-1.5-and-delivery` | **Phase 1.5 token wall + core-bypass close + WP/Shopify delivery** | ✅ MERGED + QA-before/after green + **DEPLOYED LIVE** (monitor); branch prunable |
| `C:\Users\ANMOL\Desktop\makoya-scanner-v3` | `feat/scanner-evidence-v3` | Scanner evidence v3 (other session) | ✅ deploy blocker fixed (`0cf0a1a` vendored HTMLCS as string module) + second-engine LIVE |
| `C:\Users\ANMOL\Desktop\makoya` | `feat/dashboards-ui-wip` | Dashboard/admin/CRM UI elevation | 🔶 WIP, unmerged — decide: finish→merge or fold into strategic frontend rebuild |
| `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` | `harden/*` | Phase H parallel agents (A/B/C) | ✅ MERGED to main — worktrees + branches can be pruned |

> **Block 10 note (data + licensing — ✅ SHIPPED):** Founder **deleted all `sites`** (clean slate; `leads` untouched) — new sites onboarded fresh. **Phase 1 widget licensing gate** is **LIVE** (config endpoint enforces per-site `license_status` + `allowed_domains`; `no-store`; fail-open infra / fail-closed not-found; monitor→enforce via `WIDGET_ENFORCE`). Migration `widget_licensing` applied to prod; merged to main (`e54b684`); deployed (`dpl_9Qpw1etTxRXtapJ7VbbsKkQ3y1mc`, makoya-gamma); verified live (unknown siteId → 200, `no-store`, `active:true` monitor-mode). **Ships OFF** — `WIDGET_ENFORCE` unset, so nothing is blocked yet; flip it only after **Phase 1.5** (signed-token wall + close direct-`core.js` bypass — Origin-lock alone is a deterrent, spoofable). Plan + threat-model: `docs/plans/PHASE-1-LICENSING.md`.

> **Block 11 note (Phase 1.5 + delivery — ✅ MERGED, ⛔ DEPLOY BLOCKED):** Built multi-agent (3 lanes) + 2 reviews + QA-before/after (all green), merged to `main` (`c8d2699`). **Lane A (gate hardening):** versioned HMAC site token (`v1.<hmac>`, `WIDGET_SIGNING_SECRET` server-only) folded into the config-endpoint verdict with a **grace rule** (missing token passes → legacy installs never break; only a *wrong* token fails); closed the direct-`core.js` auto-init bypass (now fetch-gated, never throws, `data-demo` escape hatch); built the real dashboard install surface (token minted server-side). **Lane B (delivery):** WordPress plugin (`wordpress-plugin/`), Shopify theme-app-extension scaffold + runbook (`shopify-app/`, founder-gated on Partner account), `docs/INSTALL.md`. **Build fix:** `build:widget:deploy` + `scripts/copy-widget-bundles.mjs` + widget tests wired into `ci` (closes the silent-stale-bundle gap — even Phase 1's loader.js had never been copied). Both kill-switches ship OFF (`WIDGET_ENFORCE` + secret unset = monitor). Plan: `docs/plans/PHASE-1.5-AND-DELIVERY.md`. **✅ DEPLOYED LIVE** (`dpl_HWjCBHvCGdP5t52nwBQwE2kfheNi`) after the scanner session fixed the deploy blocker (`0cf0a1a`, vendored HTMLCS as a string module → removed the breaking `outputFileTracingRoot`); verified live (loader `?t=`, core fetch-gates, config `no-store`, scanner 200). Set `WIDGET_SIGNING_SECRET` in Vercel + watch monitor logs before ever flipping `WIDGET_ENFORCE` (see plan A2 truth table).

**Rules:** one worktree = one branch = one agent · don't develop two features in one checkout · if two lanes need the same shared file (`packages/shared`, `package.json`, `lib/email`), STOP and coordinate · deploy only from clean `main` (`vercel --prod` from `apps/web`; no GitHub auto-deploy) · update this board when a lane merges/ends.

**Branches to prune (merged or superseded — all on origin, safe):** `harden/api-security`, `harden/ci-quality`, `harden/test-depth`, `feat/scanner-trustworthy-v2`, `phase-1-foundation`, `phase-2-widget-customizer`, `phase-3-scanner`, `phase-4-admin-crm`, `phase-5-polish`, `ws2-client-dashboard`, `ws3-admin-dashboard`, `chore/phase-0-foundation`, `feat/landing-page`, `feat/pdf-report-export`, `feat/phase-1-scanner-funnel`, `fix/landing-auth-redirect`, `fix/widget-scroll-contain`. *(Confirm before delete.)*

## ⛔ Blocked on founder (access / accounts)

| Blocker | Unblocks | Free? |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe account** (test mode ok) | Phase 2 billing. ⚠️ Stripe ≠ MoR → founder owns tax/VAT | Free acct; ~2.9%+30¢/txn |
| Enable Supabase leaked-password protection | Phase H security (Auth → toggle) | Free, 30 sec |
| ~~Sentry~~ ✅ · ~~Upstash~~ ✅ · ~~PostHog~~ ✅ wired (US cloud, live) · Inngest (keys) · Stripe (founder setting up later) | scan queue (Inngest) + billing (Stripe) remain | Free tiers |
| Rotate Anthropic + Resend keys | Security (pasted in chat earlier) | — |
| Own booking-system embed code | Phase 3 book-a-call (placeholder slot for now) | — |

## 🎯 Up next (recommended order)

1. ✅ Scanner-v2 + Phase H code/DB/CI hardening — DONE + deployed + live-QA'd.
2. **Cleanup:** remove merged agent worktrees + scanner worktree; prune merged/stale branches (all backed up).
3. **Wire monitoring** once founder creates the free accounts (Sentry/PostHog/Upstash/Inngest).
4. **Phase 2 — Stripe billing** (test mode): checkout + signature-verified idempotent webhook → plan gating.
5. **Phase 4 — Features:** Inngest scan queue · scheduled monitoring + "score dropped" alerts · AI remediation (human-confirmed) · WordPress plugin.
6. **Booking:** drop founder's real embed into the placeholder slot.
7. **Strategic frontend rebuild** — research-led, deliberate (last, on a finished backend).

> **Strategy (locked 2026-06-24/25):** Backend + features first behind a minimal beautiful demo frontend; harden everything to bulletproof before new features; then redo the whole frontend strategically (research first). Decide the dashboard-UI-wip fate (finish vs fold into rebuild).

## 📋 Update protocol (for every agent, every block)

**START of a block:** read this file + claim/confirm your lane on the agent board.

**END of a block, in order:**
1. **`STATUS.md`** — the dashboard. Edit the table cells, agent board, "Up next", and the `Last updated`/`Updated by` line. Keep it scannable.
2. **`SESSION.md`** — append the detailed narrative entry (what/why/verification).
3. If structure/guardrails changed, reflect it in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Honesty rule:** mark ✅ only when *verified* (tests run, browser/live-checked). 🔶 in-progress, ⛔ blocked. Never claim done without evidence.

**gbrain:** local searchable brain (see CLAUDE.md `## GBrain Configuration`). Re-seed after big changes: `cat docs/STATUS.md | gbrain put "makoya-status-dashboard"`.
